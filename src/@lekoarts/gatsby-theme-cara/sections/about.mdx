## About

> As a frontend developer, I focus on solving problems. Putting an emphasis on loyalty and honesty with clients and fellow team members. Passionate about the JAM stack, I strive for intuitiveness in all the work that I do, doing everything that I can to make users' experiences smooth, easy, and comfortable.

I work with both Vue.js and React.js regularly, and try to use these tools to the best of my ability in order to bring my clients' UI visions to life. My preferred CSS preprocesor is Sass, and my ability to style the pages and platforms that I develops is noteworthy, my technical skills complemented nicely by my fashionable eye. Considering at all times what will make interfaces attractive and what will make them efficient, I try to develop in a way that plays to users' expectations â€“ while also surprising them pleasantly with unique and different ideas.
